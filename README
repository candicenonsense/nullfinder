nullfinder
==========

Small program for extracting data from sparse files with unknown structures 
(like GPU memory dumps.)

nullfinder uses blocks of nulls as breaks between data.  It can then extract
data at the addresses between nulls.   It will continue to glob nulls together,
allowing a map to be made.  By default the program uses 8 nulls as a marker.

compile:
g++ -std=c++0x -o nullf nullfinder.cc map_file.cc error.cc

usage: 
./nullf [--extract] datafile

(output snippet)

71fffc nulls begin 722800 end 
722800 data begins 294001f ends
2940017 nulls begin 2940023 end 

The program will also extract the data fragments into location-marked files
using the --extract option.

bugs:
An argument to change the null-block length exists but does not work.
