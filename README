nullfinder
==========

Small program for extracting data from sparse files with unknown structures 
(like GPU memory dumps.)

nullfinder uses blocks of nulls as breaks between data.  It can then extract
data at the addresses between nulls.   It will continue to glob nulls together,
allowing a map to be made.  By default the program uses 8 nulls as a marker.

compile:
g++ -std=c++0x -o nullf nullfinder.cc map_file.cc error.cc

usage: 
./nullf [--extract] datafile

(output snippet)

0 data begins 2801a ends, size 163866
2801a nulls begin 2ad18 end 
2ad18 data begins 2f3c07 ends, size 2920175
2f3c07 nulls begin 2f5868 end 
2f5868 data begins 2f5a07 ends, size 415
2f5a07 nulls begin 2f5a08 end 
2f5a08 data begins 2f5b32 ends, size 298
2f5b32 nulls begin 2f5bc9 end 
2f5bc9 data begins 2f5bd4 ends, size 11
2f5bd4 nulls begin 2f5bf1 end 
2f5bf1 data begins 2f5bfc ends, size 11
2f5bfc nulls begin 2f5c00 end 
2f5c00 data begins 2f7354 ends, size 5972

The program will also extract the data fragments into location-marked files
using the --extract option.

Files are created as filename-address.extract.

bugs:
An argument to change the null-block length exists but does not work.
Program fragments are created in same directory as source.
